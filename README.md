# Automatic_Car_Wash
This is a coursework project created to learn PLC Ladder Logic Programming on Siemens PLC.

Automatic car washing system is very common in developed countries. Car washing system is usually associated with fuel filling stations. It consists of large machines with automated brushes controlled by program logical controllers (PLC).

Automatic car washing system is fully automated with different stages of foaming, washing, drying and brushing. An automatic car washing system is discussed in this report. This system uses large quantity of water, thus water recycling plant is also an integral part of the automatic car washing system but at this level we are only presented the car washing only. We have observed some of the car washing systems from Internet and decided to do this project.

As compared to the foreign countries this system at the present time is used in very few cities in India because of its cost and complexity. But we have tried to minimize it according to the device list which will be definitely helpful for our project. This project simulation has been implemented on Siemens PLC S7-200.
